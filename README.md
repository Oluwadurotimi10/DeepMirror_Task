# DeepMirror_Task
### Step 1: After researching, I decided to use detectron2 Mask-RCNN implementation for this task because of its easy setup, understandable codebase and active community. The next thing is to fork the [repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) then clone it into your local system.
### Step2: Upload your detectron2 folder to your google drive, since colab will be used for erunning the notebooks.
### Step 3: Create a [notebook]( in your working directory for obtaining your desired subset of the COCO dataset. For this task, the Bus category was used.
